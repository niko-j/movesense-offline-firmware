# TODO

## Firmware Features / Research

- Implement: Write optimized offline data samples with DataLogger
  - Debug: "no sbemChunkId found, cannot write to log file"
  
- Research: Delta compression
  
## Configurator Tool

- All done for now!
  
## Nice-to-Haves (not strictly inside of the scope of the thesis)

- Low power mode
  - Disable all subscription, disable BLE adv
  - Will consume 2x FullPowerOff, still low
  - Could replace full power off
  - This will preserve RTC
- Tool to parse SBEM format and visualize data
